## Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to uncover key business insights, focusing on revenue trends, customer segmentation, and seller performance. The analysis was conducted using SQL and Power BI, and the results were compiled into a professional business report.

## Objectives
- Analyze product category performance to identify high-revenue categories.
- Examine customer spending patterns to segment and target effectively.
- Assess seller performance by region to uncover untapped opportunities.
- Identify monthly revenue trends to align marketing strategies with demand.

## Data Sources

- **Order_Items.csv**: Data on purchased products and pricing.
- **Products.csv**: Product category and other details.
- **Sellers.csv**: Seller IDs and regional information.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Advanced queries to extract insights directly from the database.
- **Power BI**: Visualizations and dashboards for dynamic insights.

## Key Insights
1. **Revenue by Product Category**:
   - `Health & Beauty` is the top-performing category, followed by `Watches` and `Tablet Accessories`.
   - Categories like `Housewares` and `Automotive` have lower revenue.
